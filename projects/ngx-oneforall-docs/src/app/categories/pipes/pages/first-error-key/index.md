The `FirstErrorKeyPipe` is a custom Angular pipe designed to extract the first error key from an `AbstractControl` instance or a `ValidationErrors` object. This functionality is particularly beneficial for presenting a single error message to the user at a time, enhancing clarity and user experience.

## Usage

The `FirstErrorKeyPipe` can be utilized with a `FormControl` or directly with a `ValidationErrors` object. Below are examples demonstrating its usage in both scenarios.

### Example 1: Using with FormControl

In this example, the pipe is applied to a `FormControl`. It retrieves the first error key if any validation errors are present; otherwise, it returns an empty string (`''`).

```html file="./demo/snippets.html"#L2-L7 {3}
```

#### Live Demo

Explore the live demonstration of this example:

{{ NgDocActions.demo("FirstErrorControlComponent") }}

### Example 2: Using with ValidationErrors

The pipe can also be directly applied to a `ValidationErrors` object, making it versatile for various use cases.

```html file="./demo/snippets.html"#L10-L13 {3}
```

By leveraging the `FirstErrorKeyPipe`, developers can streamline error handling in Angular forms, ensuring a more user-friendly interface.
