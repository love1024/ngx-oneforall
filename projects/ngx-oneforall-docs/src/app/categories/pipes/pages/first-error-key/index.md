The `FirstErrorKeyPipe` is a custom Angular pipe that simplifies error handling in forms by extracting the first error key from an `AbstractControl` instance or a `ValidationErrors` object. This pipe is particularly useful for displaying a single, clear error message to users, improving both usability and user experience.

## Why Use FirstErrorKeyPipe?

When working with Angular forms, managing validation errors can become complex, especially when multiple validators are applied to a single form control. The `FirstErrorKeyPipe` helps streamline this process by focusing on the first error key, allowing developers to prioritize and display the most relevant error message.

## How It Works

The `FirstErrorKeyPipe` can be applied in two primary scenarios:

1. **With a `FormControl`**: Extracts the first error key from the control's validation errors.
2. **With a `ValidationErrors` object**: Directly processes a validation errors object, making it flexible for various use cases.

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Applying the Pipe to a FormControl

In this scenario, the pipe is used with a `FormControl` to retrieve the first error key. If the control has validation errors, the pipe returns the first error key; otherwise, it returns an empty string (`''`).

#### Code Example

```html file="./demo/snippets.html"#L2-L7 {3}

```

#### Live Demo

Experience this example in action:

{{ NgDocActions.demo("FirstErrorControlComponent") }}

### Example 2: Using the Pipe with a ValidationErrors Object

The `FirstErrorKeyPipe` can also be applied directly to a `ValidationErrors` object, making it versatile for scenarios where you need to process validation errors outside of a `FormControl`.

#### Code Example

```html file="./demo/snippets.html"#L10-L13 {3}

```

#### Live Demo

Explore this example in a live demonstration:

{{ NgDocActions.demo("FirstErrorValidationComponent") }}

## Benefits of Using FirstErrorKeyPipe

- **Simplifies Error Handling**: Focuses on the first error, reducing complexity in form validation logic.
- **Improves User Experience**: Displays a single, clear error message, avoiding confusion caused by multiple error messages.
- **Flexible and Reusable**: Works seamlessly with both `FormControl` and `ValidationErrors` objects.

By incorporating the `FirstErrorKeyPipe` into your Angular applications, you can enhance the clarity and usability of your forms, ensuring a smoother experience for your users.
