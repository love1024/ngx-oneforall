Hash functions are commonly used in software development for generating unique identifiers, checksums, or for securely storing data. In Angular applications, hash functions can be utilized for various purposes, such as caching, data integrity checks, or creating unique keys for objects.

Below, we discuss two hash functions implemented in TypeScript and their usage in Angular projects.

## Implementation of Hash Functions

### 1. `hashCode`

The `hashCode` function generates a hash value for a given string. It uses bitwise operations to compute a numeric hash.

```typescript
export function hashCode(str: string): number {
    return str.split('').reduce((a, b) => {
        a = (a << 5) - a + b.charCodeAt(0);
        return a & a;
    }, 0);
}
```

#### How It Works:
1. The input string is split into an array of characters.
2. The `reduce` function iterates over each character, calculating a hash value using bitwise left shift (`<<`) and addition.
3. The result is masked using the bitwise AND operator (`&`) to ensure the hash value remains within a 32-bit integer range.

### 2. `hashCodeWithSalt`

The `hashCodeWithSalt` function extends the functionality of `hashCode` by incorporating a salt value. A salt is an additional string that makes the hash more unique and secure.

```typescript
export function hashCodeWithSalt(str: string, salt: string): number {
    return str.split('').reduce((a, b) => {
        a = (a << 5) - a + b.charCodeAt(0);
        return a & a;
    }, hashCode(salt));
}
```

#### How It Works:
1. The function starts with the hash value of the provided salt, calculated using `hashCode`.
2. It then processes the input string in the same way as `hashCode`, combining the salt's hash with the string's hash.

## Usage in Angular Applications

### Example: Generating Unique Identifiers
You can use these hash functions to generate unique keys for caching or identifying objects in your Angular application.

```typescript
import { hashCode, hashCodeWithSalt } from './hash-utils';

const uniqueKey = hashCode('exampleString');
console.log('Unique Key:', uniqueKey);

const saltedKey = hashCodeWithSalt('exampleString', 'mySalt');
console.log('Salted Key:', saltedKey);
```

### Example: Data Integrity Check
Hash functions can be used to verify the integrity of data by comparing hash values before and after transmission.

```typescript
const originalData = 'AngularHashExample';
const hash = hashCode(originalData);

// Simulate data transmission
const receivedData = 'AngularHashExample';
if (hash === hashCode(receivedData)) {
    console.log('Data integrity verified.');
} else {
    console.log('Data integrity compromised.');
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Salts for Security**: When using hash functions for sensitive data, always include a salt to make the hash more secure.
2. **Avoid Collisions**: While these hash functions are simple and efficient, they are not cryptographically secure. For critical applications, consider using libraries like `crypto` or `bcrypt`.
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure that the hash functions meet your application's requirements for uniqueness and performance.

By incorporating these hash functions into your Angular application, you can efficiently handle tasks requiring unique identifiers or data verification. Always evaluate the specific needs of your project to determine the most suitable hashing approach.
