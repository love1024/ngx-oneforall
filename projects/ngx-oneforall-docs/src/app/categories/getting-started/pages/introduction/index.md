> **One For All** - A single library providing the essential blocks for modern Angular development.


# Key Features

### Performance & Efficiency
Every utility is written from scratch and optimized specifically for Angular. We prioritize memory efficiency and runtime performance rather than just wrapping existing heavy libraries.

### Modular & Tree-shakable
Import only what you use. The library is fully tree-shakable, so adding one utility doesn't bloat your bundle with the rest of the library.

### Zero Dependencies
We keep the dependency tree clean. **ngx-oneforall** has **NO third-party dependencies** (except `libphonenumber-js` for the phone validator). This reduces security risks, simplifies updates, and prevents version conflicts.

### First-Class SSR Support
Built for modern hydration. Every component and utility is designed to work seamlessly in Server-Side Rendering (SSR) environments out of the box.

### 100% Test Coverage
We take reliability seriously. The entire library is fully covered by tests to ensure edge cases are handled and behavior remains consistent across updates.

### Built for Modern Angular
Designed with **Signals** and **Standalone Components** in mind. This isn't a legacy port—it's built for the current and future state of Angular.

# Why Use It?

### Stop Re-writing Utilities
Avoid copy-pasting the same regex patterns, validators, and helper functions between projects. Use a standardized, tested set of utilities instead.

### Focus on Business Logic
Don't waste time maintaining generic boilerplate code. Use these proven primitives to build your actual application features faster.

### Better Developer Experience
Fully typed APIs and consistent behavior make these utilities predictable and easy to work with. You get strict typing and comprehensive documentation right in your IDE.
