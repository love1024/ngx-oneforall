`SimpleChangesTyped` is a strongly-typed utility type in Angular that provides a way to represent and track changes to component input properties during the Angular lifecycle, specifically within the `ngOnChanges` lifecycle hook. This type enhances type safety and ensures that changes to component inputs are properly typed, making it easier to work with and reducing potential runtime errors.

### Structure:
- `SimpleChangesTyped<T>` is a mapped type that takes a generic type `T`, representing the component's input properties.
- For each property `P` in `T`, it maps to an optional `ComponentChange<T, P>` object, which contains detailed information about the change for that specific property.

### `ComponentChange<T, P>`:
This interface describes the structure of the change object for a specific property:
- `previousValue: T[P]` - The previous value of the property before the change occurred.
- `currentValue: T[P]` - The current value of the property after the change occurred.
- `firstChange: boolean` - A boolean flag indicating whether this is the first time the property has changed.

### Usage:
This type is particularly useful when you want to ensure that the `SimpleChanges` object passed to the `ngOnChanges` lifecycle hook is strongly typed. By using `SimpleChangesTyped<T>`, you can define the expected structure of the changes object based on the component's input properties.

### Example:
```typescript
@Component({
    selector: 'app-example',
    template: `<p>Example Component</p>`
})
export class ExampleComponent implements OnChanges {
    @Input() name: string;
    @Input() age: number;

    ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChangesTyped<ExampleComponent>): void {
        if (changes.name) {
            console.log('Name changed from', changes.name.previousValue, 'to', changes.name.currentValue);
        }
        if (changes.age?.firstChange) {
            console.log('Age was set for the first time:', changes.age.currentValue);
        }
    }
}
```

### Benefits:
- **Type Safety**: Ensures that the `SimpleChanges` object is strongly typed, reducing the risk of accessing undefined or incorrect properties.
- **Improved Developer Experience**: Provides better autocompletion and type checking in IDEs, making it easier to work with Angular's lifecycle hooks.
- **Readability and Maintainability**: Makes the code more self-documenting and easier to understand for other developers.
