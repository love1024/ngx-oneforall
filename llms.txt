## Decorators

- [Cache](https://love1024.github.io/ngx-oneforall/decorators/cache): The Cache decorator caches Observable method results with configurable storage, TTL, and versioning.
- [Catch Error](https://love1024.github.io/ngx-oneforall/decorators/catch-error): The CatchError decorator catches errors and provides fallback behavior for sync, Promise, and Observable methods.
- [Debounce](https://love1024.github.io/ngx-oneforall/decorators/debounce): The debounce decorator delays method execution until a specified time has passed since the last call. Supports leading/trailing edge execution.
- [Log Execution Time](https://love1024.github.io/ngx-oneforall/decorators/log-execution-time): The LogExecutionTime decorator logs method execution time. Works with sync, Promise, and Observable methods.
- [Memoize](https://love1024.github.io/ngx-oneforall/decorators/memoize): The @memoize decorator caches method results based on arguments. Works with sync and Promise methods.
- [Only In Browser](https://love1024.github.io/ngx-oneforall/decorators/only-in-browser): The OnlyInBrowser decorator ensures methods only execute in browser environment, not during SSR.
- [Throttle](https://love1024.github.io/ngx-oneforall/decorators/throttle): The throttle decorator limits method execution to once per delay period. Unlike debounce, it executes immediately.

## Directives

- [Auto Focus](https://love1024.github.io/ngx-oneforall/directives/auto-focus): Automatically focuses an element when rendered, with reactive two-way binding support.

- [Typed Template](https://love1024.github.io/ngx-oneforall/directives/typed-template): The TypedTemplateDirective provides a way to strictly type the context of your ng-template definitions. By default, Angular templates are weakly typed (any or Object), which can lead to runtime errors when accessing properties that don't exist. This directive bridges that gap, leveraging TypeScript's power directly within your templates.
- [Visibility Change](https://love1024.github.io/ngx-oneforall/directives/visibility-change): Detects when an element enters or leaves the viewport using IntersectionObserver.

## Guards

- [Catch Error With Fallback](https://love1024.github.io/ngx-oneforall/rxjs/catch-error-with-fallback): The catchErrorWithFallback operator provides a clean, flexible way to handle errors in RxJS streams by automatically switching to a fallback value, observable, or dynamically generated result when an error occurs.
- [Data Polling](https://love1024.github.io/ngx-oneforall/rxjs/data-polling): It uses timer and switchMap to repeatedly call a loader function, making it perfect for real-time data updates.
- [Debug](https://love1024.github.io/ngx-oneforall/rxjs/debug): The operator uses different console methods and colors to help you distinguish between event types:
- [Live Search](https://love1024.github.io/ngx-oneforall/rxjs/live-search): It combines debounceTime, distinctUntilChanged, and switchMap to provide an optimal search experience.
