**ngx-oneforall** is a collection of 80+ high-quality Angular utilities designed to solve common development challenges. Instead of reinventing the wheel or managing dozens of small dependencies, you get a unified toolkit that just works.

> **One For All** - A single library providing the essential blocks for modern Angular development.

## Key Features

- **Performance First**: Every utility is written from scratch and optimized specifically for Angular.
- **Tree-Shakable**: Import only what you need. Zero bundle bloat.
- **Zero Dependencies**: Keeps your dependency tree clean and secure.
- **SSR Ready**: Built for modern hydration and server-side rendering.
- **Modern Angular**: Designed for Signals and Standalone Components.

## Why Use It?

- **Stop Re-writing Utilities**: Avoid copy-pasting the same regex patterns, validators, and helper functions between projects.
- **Focus on Business Logic**: Don't waste time maintaining generic boilerplate code. Use proven primitives.
- **Better Developer Experience**: Fully typed APIs and consistent behavior make coding a joy.
