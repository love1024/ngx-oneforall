`ngx-oneforall` is a comprehensive Angular library designed to streamline development by providing a collection of reusable utilities. It includes a wide range of features such as pipes, directives, services, decorators, constants, and more to enhance productivity and maintainability in Angular projects.

## Goal

The goal of this library is to reduce boilerplate in Angular applications by offering a single, dedicated package containing the most frequently used features.

## Principles

- The library focuses on performance and a small memory footprint by including only the most commonly used features. For advanced use cases, consider using a dedicated library.
- Import only what you need—each feature is available as a submodule. This helps keep your build size small.
- Server-side rendering is considered throughout the library, especially in directives, so you can use it confidently in SSR scenarios.

## Features

- **Pipes**: Simplify data transformation in templates with a variety of reusable pipes.
- **Directives**: Extend Angular's functionality with custom directives for common use cases.
- **Services**: Leverage pre-built services to handle common application logic.
- **Decorators**: Use custom decorators to reduce boilerplate code and improve readability.
- **Constants and Enums**: Access predefined constants and enums to maintain consistency across your application.

## Installation

Work in progress—package will be published soon.
